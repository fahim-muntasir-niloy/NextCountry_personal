I'm going to transfer you to the nomad visa agent to find the best options for you.

Given your circumstances, including a previous unresolved visa denial and a criminal record, it will be challenging to obtain a digital nomad visa. However, I can provide some information regarding your countries of interest (Nepal, Bhutan, and China), and keeping in mind your income and savings, I will focus on countries with lower cost of living.

**General Advice:** It's crucial to be upfront and honest about your previous visa denial and criminal record in any visa application.

It's essential to consult directly with the embassies or consulates of these countries to understand your options and any potential restrictions.
