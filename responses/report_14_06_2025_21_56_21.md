Okay, I understand you're a Bangladeshi national looking to explore digital nomad opportunities in South Asian countries like Nepal or Bhutan, ideally with your spouse. Given your income and savings, we'll focus on affordable options that don't necessarily require opening a company or seeking tax benefits. Since you plan to return home after your visa expires, we'll prioritize straightforward, temporary visas.

I will exclude Bangladesh from the list of countries and visa types.

I'm transferring you to the nomad visa agent to explore the best options for you.

Okay, I can help you find suitable digital nomad destinations in South Asia for you and your spouse. Based on your answers, here's what I recommend:

**1. Visa Options:**

*   **Nepal:** Given your income and savings, Nepal could be a good option. Let me check the visa requirements.

I was unable to find specific information about a Digital Nomad Visa for Nepal. However, I did find some information regarding Digital Nomad Visas for the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.

Based on your requirements, here's what I recommend, along with some important considerations:

**Countries to Explore:**

*   **Nepal:**
    *   **Visa Options:** Since Nepal doesn't explicitly offer a digital nomad visa, you should explore tourist visas or other visa types that allow for an extended stay. Please note that working remotely while on a tourist visa might not be officially permitted, so it's crucial to research and comply with local regulations.
    *   **Cost of Living:** Nepal is known for its affordability, especially outside of Kathmandu.
    *   **Attractions:** Explore the Himalayas, including Mount Everest, ancient temples, and vibrant culture.
    *   **Accommodation:** You can find guesthouses and apartments for rent at reasonable prices.
    *   **Important:** Given your income level, Nepal might be a good fit.
*   **Bhutan:**
    *   **Visa Options:** Bhutan has a unique tourism policy. Tourists generally need to book their trip through a licensed Bhutanese tour operator and pay a daily tariff.
    *   **Cost of Living:** Can be higher than Nepal due to the tourism policy.
    *   **Attractions:** Stunning landscapes, monasteries, and unique cultural experiences.
    *   **Important:** Research the latest tourism regulations and costs.
*   **Other South Asian Countries:**
    *   **India:** Explore visa options for long-term stays or business visas that might suit your remote work.
    *   **Sri Lanka:** Offers a digital nomad visa program. You can check requirements and apply.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Visa Research:**
    *   For each country, use the `search_exa` or `search_tavily` tool to find the official immigration websites. Look for information on tourist visas, extended stay visas, or any programs that might accommodate digital nomads.
    *   Check the specific requirements, application procedures, and any restrictions on working remotely.
2.  **Accommodation:**
    *   Use `search_tavily` to find websites or platforms for booking accommodation in your chosen locations.
    *   Consider factors like internet connectivity, proximity to amenities, and safety.
3.  **Flights:**
    *   Once you have a better idea of your destination and visa situation, use online travel agencies to find affordable flights.
4.  **Legal and Tax Advice:**
    *   Consult with an immigration lawyer or tax advisor to ensure you comply with all local laws and regulations.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Income Thresholds:** Some digital nomad visas have minimum income requirements. Since your monthly income is less than $1,500, focus on countries with lower or no specific income thresholds for tourist or other applicable visas.
*   **Visa Extensions:** Since you don't plan to extend your stay, make sure the visa you choose aligns with your intended duration.
*   **Dependents:** Ensure that your chosen visa allows your spouse and dependents to join you and understand any additional requirements for them.

I hope this helps you in planning your digital nomad journey!
