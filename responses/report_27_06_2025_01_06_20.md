**üåç Top Recommended Countries & Visas:**

1.  **Canada** ‚Äî Startup Visa üá®üá¶ (Eligibility: 75%)
    *   **Visa Category:** Startup Visa Program (SUV)
    *   **Ideal for:** Entrepreneurs with innovative businesses that can create jobs for Canadians and compete globally. It's a direct path to Permanent Residency!
    *   **Key Considerations:**
        *   **Language Requirement:** This is a crucial point. The Canadian Startup Visa *does* require a minimum level of **Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 5** in English or French. This means you will need to take an approved language test (like IELTS or CELPIP). While you expressed a preference for no language tests, this is a mandatory requirement for the Canada SUV.
        *   **Support from Designated Organization:** You must secure a Letter of Support from a designated Canadian venture capital fund (minimum $200,000 CAD investment), angel investor group (minimum $75,000 CAD investment), or business incubator (no minimum investment, but must be accepted into their program). Your existing VC backing and search for angel funding align well with this.
        *   **Qualifying Business:** Your business must be innovative, create jobs in Canada, and be competitive globally. You and your co-founder must own at least 10% of the voting rights in the business, and together, the founders must hold more than 50% of the voting rights.
        *   **Family Inclusion:** Excellent news! Your spouse/partner can be included in your application and will also receive permanent residency, granting access to healthcare and education.
        *   **Post-Relocation Support:** Canada offers various resources for company setup and incorporation. You'll need to register your business federally or provincially.
    *   **Estimated Costs:**
        *   **Gov Visa Fee (Application Processing Fee):** Approximately $2,140 CAD (for primary applicant + spouse).
        *   **Legal Fee:** Varies significantly based on lawyer expertise, but typically ranges from $10,000 - $25,000 CAD.
        *   **Translation & Notary Fee:** Approximately $500 - $1,000 CAD (for required documents).
        *   **Flight & Relocation Price (Angola to Canada):** Roughly $2,000 - $4,000 CAD per person for a one-way flight, so ~$4,000 - $8,000 CAD for two.
        *   **Rent (Monthly, for 2-bedroom apartment):** Approximately $2,000 - $3,500 CAD, depending on the city.
        *   **Food (Monthly):** Roughly $800 - $1,200 CAD for two people.
        *   **Transport (Monthly):** Approximately $150 - $250 CAD per person for public transport.
        *   **Utilities (Monthly):** Around $200 - $400 CAD (electricity, heating, internet, water).
        *   **Health Insurance:** While Canada has universal healthcare, you might need private temporary insurance for the initial period until you qualify for provincial health plans. Estimate $100 - $300 CAD per month initially.
        *   **Other (Miscellaneous Monthly):** Budget an additional $500 - $1,000 CAD for unexpected expenses, entertainment, etc.
        *   **Settlement Funds:** You must demonstrate you have sufficient funds to support yourself and your family upon arrival. For two people, this is **$15,772 CAD**. Your stated funds of $50k-$200k USD easily cover this.

    *   **Starter Documents:** Letter of Support from a designated organization, proof of settlement funds, language test results, business plan, personal identification documents, police certificates (considering your previous appeal), and medical exam results.

2.  **United States of America** ‚Äî O-1 Visa (Extraordinary Ability) üá∫üá∏ (Eligibility: 70%)
    *   **Visa Category:** O-1A (Individuals with Extraordinary Ability in Business, Science, Education, or Athletics)
    *   **Ideal for:** Entrepreneurs who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in their field, meaning a level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field.
    *   **Key Considerations:**
        *   **E-2 Visa Ineligibility:** Unfortunately, as an Algerian national, you are **not eligible** for the E-2 Treaty Investor visa, as Algeria is not a treaty country with the United States.
        *   **No Language Test:** There is no specific language test requirement for the O-1 visa. However, the application process heavily relies on showcasing your achievements and influence, which often involves strong communication skills for presentations, networking, and expert testimonials.
        *   **Extraordinary Ability Proof:** This is the most challenging aspect. You'll need substantial documentation proving sustained national or international acclaim, such as major awards, membership in elite associations, published material about you, judging the work of others, original scientific/scholarly contributions of major significance, authorship of scholarly articles, or a high salary/other remuneration for services. Your VC backing and co-founder indicate business acumen, but you'd need to demonstrate *your personal extraordinary contributions* to the field.
        *   **Family Inclusion:** Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 can apply for O-3 dependent visas.
    *   **Estimated Costs:**
        *   **Gov Visa Fee (Application Processing Fee):** Around $460 USD for the I-129 petition.

        *   **Translation & Notary Fee:** Approximately $500 - $1,000 USD.
        *   **Flight & Relocation Price (Angola to USA):** Roughly $2,000 - $5,000 USD per person, so ~$4,000 - $10,000 USD for two.
        *   **Rent (Monthly, for 2-bedroom apartment in major startup hubs):** Highly variable, but expect $3,000 - $6,000+ USD.
        *   **Food (Monthly):** Roughly $1,000 - $1,500 USD for two people.
        *   **Transport (Monthly):** Approximately $100 - $300 USD per person (public transport varies by city, car ownership adds significant costs).
        *   **Utilities (Monthly):** Around $250 - $500 USD.
        *   **Health Insurance:** This is a significant cost in the US. Expect $500 - $1,500+ USD per month for two people, depending on coverage.
        *   **Other (Miscellaneous Monthly):** Budget an additional $800 - $1,500 USD.
        *   **Company Setup & Incorporation:** Varies by state, but expect initial filing fees from $50 - $500 USD, plus legal and registered agent fees. Budget $1,000 - $5,000 USD for initial setup.

**‚ù§Ô∏è Personal Note:**

Given your main goal of an immigration pathway and your family situation, **Canada's Startup Visa** is generally a more straightforward and direct path to permanent residency compared to the US options, even with the language requirement. Canada's system is designed to attract immigrant entrepreneurs, and the ability to include your spouse/partner for permanent residency right away is a huge advantage. While the language test is a hurdle, achieving CLB 5 is attainable with preparation.

The **USA's O-1 visa** is an option if you can unequivocally demonstrate "extraordinary ability" based on your personal achievements and contributions. While it doesn't have a direct language test, the process to prove extraordinary ability is rigorous and costly.

---

**üìä Summary & Recommendations:**

*   You‚Äôre most likely to succeed with the **Canada Startup Visa** üá®üá¶ if you can meet the CLB 5 language requirement and secure the necessary Letter of Support from a designated organization. This visa offers a clear pathway to permanent residency for you and your spouse/partner.
*   The **USA O-1 Visa** üá∫üá∏ is a possibility, but it hinges entirely on your ability to demonstrate "extraordinary ability" through a strong portfolio of personal achievements, which can be a high bar to meet.
*   Your existing significant VC funding is a strong asset for both options, particularly for securing support from designated organizations in Canada.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  **For Canada:** Begin researching and connecting with Canadian designated organizations (Venture Capital Funds, Angel Investor Groups, Business Incubators) to pitch your startup and secure a Letter of Support. Simultaneously, start preparing for an English or French language test to meet the CLB 5 requirement.
    2.  **For USA:** If you wish to pursue the O-1, gather all documentation that showcases your extraordinary ability in your industry. This would involve a deep dive into your professional accolades, publications, and impact.
    3.  **Financial Planning:** While you have significant funds, ensure you budget thoroughly for all application fees, legal costs, and initial settlement expenses for your chosen country.
