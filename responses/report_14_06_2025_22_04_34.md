Based on your interest in an active business investment in the technology sector in Asia with an investment of less than $100,000, and your goal of securing a safe future for your family and building a real estate portfolio, I have identified a potential option in Thailand.

The **Thailand Smart Visa (Smart S - Startup)** appears to be the most aligned with your investment budget and interest in the technology sector.

Here's a breakdown of why it could be suitable and some points to consider:

**Thailand Smart Visa (Smart S - Startup)**

*   **Investment Amount:** The Smart S visa for a 2-year duration requires a deposit of no less than 600,000 Baht (approximately USD 16,000). For a 1-year visa, if you participate in an incubation program, the same deposit applies. This comfortably fits your "less than $100,000" investment criteria.
*   **Active Business in Technology:** This visa is specifically designed for technology-based startup entrepreneurs in targeted industries, which aligns with your interest in technology and your desire for an active business investment where you run your own company. You would need to establish a certified startup company in Thailand or participate in an endorsed incubation/accelerator program.
*   **Family Inclusion:** Spouses and children are granted permission to stay in Thailand for the same duration as the Smart Visa holder. An additional deposit of no less than 180,000 Baht (approximately USD 5,000) per person is required for accompanying family members. With more than 5 dependents, this would add to the total deposit, but it should still remain within your budget. For example, if you have 6 dependents (spouse + 5 children), the additional deposit would be 6 * 180,000 Baht = 1,080,000 Baht (approx. USD 29,000), bringing the total required deposit to 1,680,000 Baht (approx. USD 45,000), which is still well within your liquid cash of $1 million+.
*   **Visa Duration:** The Smart S visa can be obtained for up to 2 years and is renewable. If you start with a 1-year visa (e.g., through an incubation program), it can be renewed for up to 2 years if you meet the requirements of being a shareholder or director of a certified company.
*   **Work Permit Exemption:** A significant privilege is that no separate work permit is required for working in the business certified by relevant agencies. Your spouse is also granted permission to work without a work permit.
*   **Processing Time:** While not explicitly stated for the Smart S, the general application approval process for the Malaysia Tech Entrepreneur Programme (a similar type of visa) is around 4 weeks, and pass issuance is 1 week. Thailand's process is likely comparable, fitting your 2+ years timeline.

**Points to Consider:**

*   **Real Estate Portfolio:** While the Smart S visa doesn't explicitly restrict real estate ownership, foreign ownership of land in Thailand is generally not permitted directly. Foreigners can typically own condominiums or lease land for up to 30 years. To build a real estate portfolio, you might need to explore specific structures like setting up a Thai company or long-term leases. I will investigate this further to provide more concrete information.
*   **Remote Investment Preference:** The Smart S visa is designed for individuals who will be actively setting up and running a business in Thailand. While some aspects of business can be managed remotely, the nature of "active business investment" and the visa's purpose imply a significant physical presence. Your preference for "remote investment" may be a challenge with this type of active business visa. You would need to assess if your specific business model allows for a mostly remote operation while still fulfilling the visa's requirements for active participation.
*   **Unemployment Status:** While you are currently unemployed, your significant liquid cash ($1 million+) will be a strong asset in demonstrating your ability to establish and fund a new technology startup in Thailand. The focus will be on your business plan and its viability.

I will now gather more specific information on foreign real estate ownership in Thailand and the precise requirements for the Smart S visa, particularly regarding the need for physical presence, to give you a more complete picture.

Based on your interest in an investment program in Asia, specifically in the technology sector with an investment budget of less than $100,000 for an active business, and your intention to move with your spouse and more than five children, I have identified two highly suitable countries: **Cambodia** and **Thailand**.

### Eligible Countries and Detailed Insights

#### 1. Cambodia
Cambodia presents a promising landscape for foreign investors, particularly with its growing economy and a government keen on attracting foreign direct investment. While traditionally known for tourism and manufacturing, Cambodia is increasingly focusing on digital transformation, creating opportunities in the technology sector. The cost of doing business and living is generally lower compared to many other Asian countries, which aligns well with your investment budget.

#### 2. Thailand
Thailand has a more established and vibrant technology ecosystem, especially in cities like Bangkok. The Thai government actively promotes innovation and investment in high-tech industries through initiatives like the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and the SMART Visa program. The country offers a skilled workforce, good infrastructure, and a strong market for technology products and services. While the cost of living can vary, it is generally manageable, and the country provides excellent educational and healthcare facilities for families.

### Recommended Location to Invest

Considering your specific requirements, **Thailand** appears to be the most suitable country for your investment.

**Reasons for Recommendation:**

*   **Established Technology Ecosystem:** Thailand has a more mature and supportive environment for technology startups and businesses. This includes incubators, accelerators, and a larger pool of talent in the tech sector, which is crucial for an active business investment.
*   **Clear Visa Pathway for Startups:** The SMART S (Startup) Visa in Thailand is specifically designed for technology-based startup entrepreneurs, aligning perfectly with your interest in the technology, chips, and electronics sector. The financial requirements for this visa are well within your stated budget of less than $100,000, even with a large family.
*   **Family Inclusion and Benefits:** The SMART S Visa explicitly outlines provisions for spouses and children, including permission for them to stay and for the spouse to work without a separate work permit. This is a significant advantage for your large family.
*   **Government Support:** The Thai government, through agencies like the National Innovation Agency and Digital Economy Promotion Agency, actively certifies and endorses technology businesses, which can provide valuable support and credibility for your venture.
*   **Quality of Life:** Thailand offers a high quality of life, diverse culture, and good infrastructure, which are important considerations for securing a safe future for your family and potentially building a real estate portfolio in the long term.

While Cambodia's EB Visa is also a viable option within your budget, Thailand's more developed technology sector and structured visa program for startups make it a more robust choice for your active business investment in technology.

### Preferred Visa Category

For Thailand, the preferred visa category is the **SMART S (Startup) Visa**.

Specifically, based on your profile, you could initially apply for the **1-year SMART S Visa** if you plan to join an incubation/accelerator program or receive joint venture funding, or the **2-year SMART S Visa** once you have established and certified your startup in Thailand and hold at least 25% of the company's registered capital or a director position. The 6-month visa is also an option for initial exploration and setting up.

### Cost Estimates for Thailand

*   **Gov Visa Fee:** The Smart Visa itself has an application fee, which can vary. For a 1-year visa, it's typically around 10,000 Baht (approx. USD 270). For a 2-year visa, it's around 20,000 Baht (approx. USD 540).
*   **Legal Fee:** This can vary significantly depending on the legal firm you choose, but a rough estimate for legal assistance with company registration and visa application could range from **$2,000 to $5,000**.
*   **Translation/Notary Fee:** This will depend on the number of documents requiring translation and notarization. Estimate **$200 - $500**.
*   **Flight/Relocation Price:** For a family of more than 5, this can be substantial. A rough estimate for flights from Bangladesh to Thailand could be **$3,000 - $6,000** or more, depending on the airline, time of year, and number of tickets.

*   **Ticket Price:** (Already covered in Flight/Relocation)

**Total Estimated Initial Costs (excluding ongoing monthly living expenses and school fees):**

*   **Investment Capital:** Minimum 600,000 Baht (approx. $16,000) for the applicant, plus 180,000 Baht per dependent (e.g., $30,000 for 6 dependents), totaling approximately **$46,000** for the required deposit.

*   **Flights/Relocation:** ~$3,000 - $6,000+

Therefore, you should anticipate initial costs (excluding your business investment capital) in the range of **$9,000 - $23,000+** to cover visa, legal, relocation, initial housing, and health insurance. Your minimum investment capital of approximately **$46,000** for the required deposit will be separate.
