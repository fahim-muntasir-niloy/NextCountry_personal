It seems there isn't a direct "startup visa" program explicitly listed for Switzerland in my current database. Switzerland has a more complex system for non-EU/EFTA citizens, often relying on cantonal quotas and requiring significant economic benefit.

Given your current residency in Germany, your VC backing, and your preference for a no-language-test route within Europe, we should explore other viable European countries that actively offer startup or entrepreneur visas. Many European countries have programs designed to attract innovative entrepreneurs, especially those with secured funding.

Let's broaden our search to identify European countries with suitable startup visa programs that align with your profile. I will prioritize countries with strong startup ecosystems that could benefit from your VC-backed venture and offer a path to residency/citizenship.While Switzerland is a preferred country, the initial search in our database did not yield specific information on a dedicated "startup visa" for non-EU citizens. This doesn't mean options aren't available, but they might fall under different categories or have specific cantonal (regional) requirements.

Given your profile as an Algerian national with German residency, a VC-backed startup, and a preference for no language tests, we should explore other European countries that actively offer startup or entrepreneur visas and have strong ecosystems for funded ventures.

Several European countries are known for their startup visa programs and might be suitable:

*   **Estonia:** Known for its e-residency program and a straightforward startup visa process.
*   **France:** Offers a "French Tech Visa" designed for founders, employees, and investors.
*   **Portugal:** Has a "Startup Visa" program, often praised for its relatively accessible entry and quality of life.
*   **Spain:** Offers an "Entrepreneur Visa" which is part of their "Golden Visa" or "Investor Visa" framework, but also has specific provisions for entrepreneurs.
*   **Ireland:** Actively seeks innovative entrepreneurs through its Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP).
*   **Netherlands:** Has a "Startup Visa" that allows non-EU entrepreneurs to launch an innovative business.
*   **Italy:** Offers an "Italia Startup Visa" aimed at attracting foreign entrepreneurs.

These countries generally have established startup ecosystems and some offer pathways that do not strictly require a language test, especially if the business is conducted in English or if the applicant meets other high-level criteria.

To provide the most tailored recommendations, I need to delve deeper into the specific requirements for these countries, particularly regarding your current funding status (VC-backed) and your desire for angel funding. This will help us identify which programs align best with your startup's stage and financial needs.

Would you like me to research Switzerland's specific entrepreneur/business visa options in more detail, or would you prefer to explore one or more of the other European countries I've listed that are known for their startup visa programs?
