### United Kingdom Startup Visa

The United Kingdom offers a **Startup Visa** route that could be highly relevant for you and your co-founder. Here’s a breakdown of how it aligns with your situation and the key requirements:

**1. Eligibility and Endorsement:**

*   **Points-Based System:** To qualify, you must score 70 points. This includes points for your business plan, its innovation, viability, and scalability (50 points), English language proficiency (10 points), and financial requirements (10 points).
*   **Endorsement:** A crucial step is obtaining an endorsement from an approved endorsing body in the UK. This body will assess your business idea for innovation, viability, and scalability. They must also confirm that you are a "fit and proper" person and that there are no concerns about the legitimacy of your funds.
*   **Team Applications:** As you are relocating with a co-founder, it's important to note that **each founder must be individually endorsed** and each must demonstrate access to the required investment funds.

**2. Financial Requirements:**

*   **Investment Funds:** For a new business, **each applicant (you and your co-founder) must have access to at least £50,000** to invest in the business. Your stated available funds of $50k-$200k (approximately £40k-£160k, depending on exchange rates) and your VC backing, along with seeking angel funding, indicate you are well-positioned to meet this requirement for both founders.
*   **Personal Savings (Maintenance Funds):** You must also demonstrate that you have at least **£1,270 in personal savings**, held for 28 consecutive days before applying, to support yourself. Additional funds will be required for your spouse/partner.

**3. English Language Requirement:**

*   The UK Startup Visa typically requires applicants to demonstrate English language proficiency at **B2 level** of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
*   **Evidence:** This can usually be proven by:
    *   Passing an approved English language test.
    *   Having a degree taught in English.
    *   Being a national of a majority English-speaking country.
*   **Your Preference:** You mentioned a preference for a "no-language-test route." While your German nationality does not automatically exempt you, if you have a university degree taught in English, this could satisfy the requirement without an additional test. Otherwise, an approved test would likely be necessary.

**4. Business Requirements:**

*   **Innovation, Viability, Scalability:** Your highly tech-driven startup is a strong asset here, as the UK visa prioritizes businesses that are genuinely innovative, have a realistic chance of growth, and potential for national or international expansion. Your VC backing further strengthens the viability aspect.
*   **Business Plan:** A detailed and credible business plan is essential to score points under the eligibility criteria.

**5. Family and Relocation Scope:**

*   **Dependants:** Your spouse/partner is eligible to apply as your dependant, provided you meet the additional financial requirements for their maintenance.
*   **Co-Founder:** As mentioned, your co-founder will need to apply individually and meet all the visa requirements, including endorsement and separate funds.

**6. Prior Visa Denial:**

*   The UK visa suitability requirements state that applicants must not fall under "General Grounds for Refusal" (e.g., criminality, deception). The fact that your previous visa denial was successfully appealed is a positive point, but you should be prepared to provide full details and documentation regarding that incident as part of your application to demonstrate transparency and resolve any potential concerns.

**7. Fees and Process:**

*   **Application Fee:** The application fee is typically around £1,191 (outside the UK) or £1,486 (inside the UK).
*   **Immigration Health Surcharge:** An additional fee of £624 per year is usually required for access to the National Health Service (NHS).
*   **Endorsement Fee:** Endorsing bodies may charge their own fees, often £1,000 + VAT.
*   **Application Process:** You must apply for and be granted the visa before arriving in the UK. You cannot enter as a visitor and then switch to the Startup Visa. Biometrics are also required.

**8. Company Setup and Incorporation:**

*   While this is a post-visa step, the UK has a very straightforward process for company setup and incorporation. You will find ample support services available once you are in the UK.
