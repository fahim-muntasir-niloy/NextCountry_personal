As a professional Travel Agency Manager specializing in startup founder migration, I can help you explore viable options for your startup in North America, considering your German nationality, funding status, and preferences.

Here's an overview of potential startup visa pathways in the United States and Canada:

### United States of America

For German citizens, the United States offers a few avenues for entrepreneurs, primarily focusing on investment and significant contribution to the U.S. economy.

**1. E-2 Treaty Investor Visa**

*   **Purpose:** This non-immigrant visa allows citizens of countries with which the U.S. maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation (Germany is one such country) to come to the U.S. to develop and direct the operations of a business in which they have invested or are actively investing a substantial amount of capital.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Nationality:** You must be a national of a treaty country.
    *   **Investment:** A "substantial" investment must be made in a bona fide enterprise in the U.S. There is no fixed minimum, but the amount must be sufficient to ensure the successful operation of the enterprise and must not be marginal (i.e., it must generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the investor and family). Your proposed funding of $50k-$200k, plus seeking an additional $100k, could be considered substantial depending on the nature and scale of your business.
    *   **Control:** You must have at least 50% ownership or operational control of the enterprise.
    *   **Role:** You must be entering the U.S. solely to develop and direct the investment enterprise.
    *   **Domicile (for German citizens who obtained nationality through financial investment):** As of December 23, 2022, if you obtained German nationality through financial investment, you must have been domiciled in Germany for at least 3 years before applying.
*   **Processing:** You can apply for the E-2 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate in Germany. If you are already in the U.S. in a lawful nonimmigrant status, you may be able to file Form I-129 to request a change of status.
*   **Note:** The E-2 visa is a non-immigrant visa, meaning it does not directly lead to permanent residency or citizenship, though it can be renewed indefinitely as long as the business continues to meet the requirements.

**2. International Entrepreneur Rule (IER)**

*   **Purpose:** This rule allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to grant parole to noncitizen entrepreneurs on a case-by-case basis, allowing them to temporarily stay in the U.S. to oversee their startup.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Ownership:** You must possess a substantial ownership interest (at least 10%) in a U.S. startup.
    *   **Recent Creation:** The startup must have been created within the past five years.
    *   **Central Role:** You must play a central role in the startup's operations and future growth.
    *   **Significant Public Benefit:** The startup must demonstrate significant public benefit to the U.S. through substantial and rapid job creation or significant U.S. investment or government grants.
        *   **Qualified Investment:** The startup must have received a qualified investment of at least $264,147 from a U.S. investor with a history of successful investments.
        *   **Qualified Award/Grant:** Or, the startup must have received an award or grant of at least $105,659 from a U.S. federal, state, or local government entity.
    *   **Funding Alignment:** Your current funding of "$50k-$200k" and "Seeking Angel Funding (up to ~$100k)" might align with the grant requirement if your angel funding materializes and meets the criteria, but it falls short of the current qualified investment threshold.
*   **Processing:** You must file Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole, with supporting documentation. If approved, you will need to obtain travel documentation before entering the U.S.
*   **Family:** Spouses and children may also be eligible for parole, and spouses may apply for work authorization.
*   **Note:** This is a parole program, not a visa category, and provides a temporary stay, not a direct path to permanent residency.

### Canada

Canada's Start-up Visa Program is a direct immigration pathway designed for entrepreneurs.

**1. Start-up Visa Program**

*   **Purpose:** This program aims to attract innovative entrepreneurs to Canada by offering permanent residence to those who can build businesses with the potential for global growth and job creation.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Qualifying Business:** Your business must be a Canadian-incorporated entity, actively managed from within Canada, with essential operations occurring in Canada.
    *   **Letter of Support:** You must obtain a Letter of Support from a designated Canadian organization (a venture capital fund, angel investor group, or business incubator) that is willing to invest in or support your startup.
    *   **Minimum Investment (if applicable):**
        *   **Venture Capital Fund:** Your startup must secure a minimum investment of $200,000 CAD.
        *   **Angel Investor Group:** Your startup must secure a minimum investment of $75,000 CAD.
        *   **Business Incubator:** No financial investment is required if you are accepted into a Canadian business incubator program.
        *   **Your Funding:** Your current funding of "$50k-$200k" and seeking "up to ~$100k" in angel funding aligns well with the angel investor group or business incubator streams.
    *   **Ownership:** You must hold at least 10% of the total voting rights in the business, and you and the designated organization must together hold more than 50% of the total voting rights.
    *   **Language Requirements:** You must meet the Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 5 in English or French across all four abilities (reading, writing, listening, and speaking). This requires taking an approved language test (e.g., CELPIP-General, IELTS General Training for English; TEF Canada, TCF Canada for French). This requirement **conflicts with your preference for a "No-Language-Test Route."**
    *   **Settlement Funds:** You must have sufficient funds to support yourself and your dependents upon arrival in Canada. The amount varies based on family size (e.g., approximately $13,757 CAD for one person, $17,127 CAD for two people, as of 2024, subject to annual updates). For "Me + Spouse/Partner," you would need approximately $17,127 CAD.
*   **Processing:** The application process involves getting a Letter of Support, submitting your application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and undergoing security and medical checks.
*   **Family:** Your spouse/partner and co-founder can be included in the application.

### Recommended Locations and Considerations

Given your preference for "Established Revenue" and seeking angel funding, combined with your desire for company setup and incorporation support, here are some suitable locations in North America:

**United States:**

While the U.S. does not have a dedicated "startup visa" leading directly to permanent residency in the same way Canada does, certain cities are renowned for their vibrant startup ecosystems and access to venture capital and angel investors.

*   **Silicon Valley (San Francisco Bay Area), California:** This is the global epicenter for tech startups and venture capital. While highly competitive, it offers unparalleled access to investors, talent, and mentorship.
*   **New York City, New York:** A hub for FinTech, ad-tech, and media startups, NYC offers a diverse economy and a strong network of angel investors and VCs.
*   **Boston, Massachusetts:** Known for its biotech, life sciences, and deep tech sectors, supported by world-class universities and a robust investment community.
*   **Austin, Texas:** A rapidly growing tech hub with a lower cost of living than coastal cities, attracting significant investment and talent.
*   **Seattle, Washington:** Strong in cloud computing, e-commerce, and AI, with major tech companies and a growing startup scene.

**Canada:**

Canada's startup ecosystem is growing rapidly, with several cities offering strong support for new businesses.

*   **Toronto, Ontario:** Canada's largest city and financial capital, with a diverse economy, a booming tech scene, and significant access to venture capital and angel investors. It offers numerous incubators and accelerators.
*   **Vancouver, British Columbia:** A gateway to the Asia-Pacific market, strong in tech, clean energy, and digital media, with a growing number of angel investors and a supportive startup community.
*   **Montreal, Quebec:** A hub for AI, gaming, and aerospace, with a vibrant startup scene and a lower cost of living compared to Toronto or Vancouver. Note: While English is widely spoken in business, French is the official language of Quebec.
*   **Waterloo Region, Ontario:** Known as "Silicon Valley North," home to major tech companies and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, with a focus on deep tech and innovation.

**Reasons for Recommendation:**

These locations are recommended because they:
*   Have **established startup ecosystems** with a high concentration of angel investors and venture capitalists, aligning with your "Already Backed by VCs" status and "Seeking Angel Funding."
*   Offer a wide range of **accelerators and incubators** that can provide mentorship, resources, and potentially the "Letter of Support" required for the Canadian Start-up Visa, and valuable networking for U.S. ventures.
*   Provide access to **talent and innovation**, crucial for scaling a startup.
*   Have professional services readily available for **company setup and incorporation**, addressing your post-relocation support needs.

### Addressing Your Preferences and Challenges:

*   **Geographic Preference (North America - Canada/USA):** Both countries offer strong options, but with different pathways to residency.
*   **Established Revenue & Current Funding:** Your current funding and search for angel investment are well-suited for both the E-2 (U.S.) and the Start-up Visa (Canada, particularly via an Angel Investor Group or Business Incubator).
*   **No-Language-Test Route:** This is a significant factor.
    *   **U.S.:** The E-2 and IER programs generally do not have explicit language test requirements. Proficiency in English will be essential for business operations but is not a formal visa prerequisite.
    *   **Canada:** The Start-up Visa Program **does require** a minimum CLB 5 in English or French. This directly conflicts with your preference. If a direct immigration pathway is paramount and you wish to pursue Canada, you would need to reconsider your stance on language testing.
*   **Immigration Pathway (Residency/Citizenship):**
    *   **Canada:** The Start-up Visa offers a direct path to permanent residency, which aligns with your long-term goal of an "Immigration Pathway."
    *   **U.S.:** The E-2 and IER are non-immigrant or parole options, providing temporary stay. While some may transition to other immigrant visas over time, it's not a direct route.
*   **Relocation Scope (Founder + Co-Founder + Spouse/Partner):** Both countries have provisions for including family members and essential team members in visa applications.
*   **Company setup and incorporation:** This support is widely available from legal and business service providers in all recommended cities in both countries.

### Summary and Next Steps:

Considering your preferences:

*   If a **direct immigration pathway to permanent residency** is your priority, **Canada's Start-up Visa Program** is the most suitable, provided you are willing to meet the **language proficiency requirement**. Its investment thresholds also align well with your funding.
*   If avoiding a **language test** is a higher priority, and you are open to a **non-immigrant/parole pathway** initially, the **U.S. E-2 Treaty Investor Visa** (given your German nationality) or the **International Entrepreneur Rule (IER)** are options. The E-2 offers more stability for business operations, while the IER requires specific investment or grant thresholds.

Given you are "Just Researching for Now" and "Not Sure / Just Exploring" long-term residency goals, it would be beneficial to:

1.  **For Canada:** Investigate Canadian designated organizations (Venture Capital Funds, Angel Investor Groups, Business Incubators) that might be a good fit for your startup and could provide a Letter of Support. Be prepared to address the language test requirement.
2.  **For the U.S.:** Consult with an immigration attorney specializing in E-2 visas or the International Entrepreneur Rule to assess the "substantial investment" for your specific business under E-2, or to evaluate if your potential angel funding could qualify as a "qualified grant/award" under the IER.

I recommend you carefully weigh the direct immigration benefits of Canada against your preference to avoid language testing, and the temporary nature of the U.S. options. Both countries offer excellent environments for startups, but the immigration pathways differ significantly.
