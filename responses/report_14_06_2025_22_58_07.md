It looks like you're interested in exploring startup visa opportunities, particularly in Ireland and the United Kingdom, given your German nationality and the fact that your startup is already VC-backed. You're seeking an immigration pathway and prefer a route without language tests, also requiring support with company setup and incorporation.

Let's explore suitable options for you.

### **Ireland**

Ireland offers the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP) for non-EEA nationals who wish to establish a high-potential startup in Ireland. While you are a German national, it's important to note that as a German citizen, you generally have the right to live and work in Ireland without a visa under EU free movement rules. However, if your long-term goal is an immigration pathway for residency/citizenship specifically tied to a startup program, the STEP program could be relevant if you were considering renouncing EU citizenship or if your co-founder is a non-EU national. Given you are a German national, the direct "startup visa" isn't typically required for you to establish a business in Ireland. However, if you are looking for specific benefits or a structured program, or if your co-founder is non-EU, then this program would be relevant.

**Detailed Insights & Suitable Locations in Ireland:**

Ireland has a vibrant and growing startup ecosystem, particularly in Dublin. It's a popular choice for tech companies due to its favorable corporation tax rate and access to the EU market.

*   **Dublin:** The capital city is the heart of Ireland's tech and startup scene, often referred to as "Silicon Docks." It offers a strong talent pool, numerous incubators and accelerators (e.g., Dogpatch Labs, NDRC), and a well-connected network of investors.
*   **Cork:** A growing hub, especially for cybersecurity and fintech startups, with a supportive local ecosystem.
*   **Galway:** Known for its med-tech and ICT sectors, offering a more affordable living and operating cost compared to Dublin.

### **United Kingdom**

Based on your preferences, the **Innovator Founder visa** is a suitable option for the United Kingdom. This visa category replaced the Start-up visa and Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa, offering a route for experienced business people to establish an innovative, scalable, and viable business in the UK.

**Key Features and Requirements for the Innovator Founder Visa:**

*   **Endorsement:** You must have your business idea endorsed by an approved endorsing body. This body will assess your business plan for innovation, viability, and scalability. They will also confirm that you are a fit and proper person and that your funds are legitimate.
*   **Investment Funds:** For a new business, each applicant typically needs access to at least **£50,000** to invest. However, if you are continuing a previously endorsed business, this investment fund requirement might be waived.
*   **Personal Savings:** You must have at least **£1,270** held for 28 consecutive days before applying, unless you have been in the UK for 12 months or more.
*   **English Language:** You need to demonstrate English language proficiency. This can be done through an approved English language test (like IELTS), a degree taught in English, or if you are a national of a majority English-speaking country. Given your preference for a "no-language-test route," if your degree was taught in English, that could fulfill this requirement.
*   **Team Applications:** Multiple founders can apply as co-directors. However, each co-founder must be individually endorsed by an approved body and, for new businesses, each must show access to the £50,000 investment funds.
*   **Dependants:** Your spouse/partner and children under 18 are eligible to join you, but additional funds will be required for their maintenance.
*   **Application Process:** You must apply for and be granted entry clearance before arriving in the UK. You cannot enter as a visitor and then switch to this visa. Biometrics are required for all applicants.
*   **Processing Times:** Standard processing is typically 3-8 weeks, but priority services may be available for an extra fee.
*   **Fees:** Application fees vary (check the latest Home Office table, but typically around £1,191 outside the UK). You will also need to pay an Immigration Health Surcharge (currently £624 per year) and an endorsement fee (which varies by endorsing body, often £1,000+VAT).
*   **Long-Term Goals:** This visa leads to settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) after a continuous period, provided you meet the requirements for continuous residence and absence.

**Why the UK is a Suitable Location:**

The UK has a vibrant and well-established startup ecosystem, particularly in cities like London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. With your secured VC funding and pursuit of angel funding, you'll find a strong network of investors, incubators, and accelerators. The UK also offers a robust legal and financial framework, access to a large market, and a diverse talent pool. The "Established Revenue" and "Already Backed by VCs" aspects of your startup align well with the Innovator Founder visa, which is designed for more mature and scalable businesses.

### **Ireland**

I will now gather information on Ireland's startup visa program, the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP), to provide you with a comprehensive comparison.



While you initially expressed interest in Ireland, it's important to note that the **Irish Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP)** is primarily designed for **non-EEA (European Economic Area) nationals**. As a German citizen, you are an EEA national, which means you may not be eligible for this specific program.

However, given your interest in nearby countries and your specific mention of the **United Kingdom**, this presents a highly suitable option for your startup ambitions. Post-Brexit, German citizens require a visa to live and work in the UK, and the **Innovator Founder visa** is an excellent pathway for entrepreneurs like yourself.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the **United Kingdom's Innovator Founder visa** and why it aligns with your goals:

### **United Kingdom: Innovator Founder Visa**

The UK offers a robust ecosystem for startups, especially for those with significant funding and a clear business plan. The Innovator Founder visa is tailored for experienced business people seeking to establish an innovative, viable, and scalable business in the UK.

**1. Eligibility and Suitability for Your Profile:**

*   **Nationality:** As a German citizen, you are eligible to apply for the Innovator Founder visa, as it is designed for individuals from outside the UK who wish to set up a business.
*   **Funding:** Your stated funding of "$50k-$200k" and being "Already Backed by VCs (significant funding secured)" fits well with the visa's investment fund requirement of at least £50,000 for a new business. Your interest in "Seeking Angel Funding (up to ~$100k)" further aligns with the UK's active angel investor network.
*   **Innovation Level:** While you're "Unsure How to Categorise" your innovation, the visa requires your business idea to be new, innovative, and different from anything else on the market. An endorsing body will assess this.
*   **Language Requirement:** You prefer a "No-Language-Test Route." The Innovator Founder visa generally requires applicants to prove English language ability (B2 level). However, you can meet this by providing evidence of a degree taught in English or being a national of a majority English-speaking country. While Germany is not a majority English-speaking country, if you have a degree taught in English, this could satisfy the requirement without an additional test.
*   **Relocation Scope:** The visa allows for "Founder + Co-Founder (or key partner)" relocation, as multiple founders can apply as co-directors, provided each is individually endorsed and can demonstrate access to the required funds.
*   **Family Situation:** The visa permits bringing dependants, including your spouse/partner and children under 18, with additional financial requirements.
*   **Established Revenue:** The UK market is well-suited for businesses with established revenue, offering opportunities for scaling and further investment.

**2. Visa Requirements for the UK Innovator Founder Visa:**

To apply for the Innovator Founder visa, you generally need to meet the following criteria:

*   **Endorsement:** This is the most critical requirement. You must have your business idea endorsed by an approved UK endorsing body.

The endorsement letter must be issued within 3 months of your application and confirm that you are a fit and proper person with no concerns about the legitimacy of your funds.
*   **Investment Funds:**
    *   For a new business, you must have access to at least **£50,000** to invest in your business. Each applicant in a team application must show access to this amount.
*   **Personal Savings:** You must have at least **£1,270** in personal savings held for 28 consecutive days before applying, unless you have been in the UK for 12 months or more. Additional funds are required for dependants.
*   **English Language Proficiency:** You must prove your English language ability at a B2 level. This can be done through an approved English language test, a degree taught in English, or if you are a national of a majority English-speaking country.
*   **Business Plan:** A detailed and comprehensive business plan outlining your innovative idea, market analysis, financial projections, and growth strategy is essential for endorsement.
*   **Age:** You must be at least 18 years old.
*   **Good Character:** You must be of good character and not have been convicted of criminal offenses. Your prior visa denial (successfully appealed) and no criminal record for you or your dependents should be clearly disclosed and explained in your application.
*   **Tuberculosis (TB) Certificate:** Required if you are from a country where a TB test is mandatory (check the official UK government guidance for the latest list).

**3. Application Process and Timeline:**

**4. Long-Term Goals (Residency/Citizenship):**

The Innovator Founder visa can lead to settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK after 3 years, provided you meet specific criteria, including demonstrating significant achievements in your business. This pathway offers a clear route to long-term residency and eventually British citizenship, aligning with your "Not Sure / Just Exploring" long-term goals.

**5. Post-Relocation Support:**

Your requirement for "Company setup and incorporation" is a common need for Innovator Founder visa holders. The UK has a straightforward company registration process, and there are many legal and accounting firms specializing in assisting new businesses with incorporation and compliance. Your endorsing body may also provide guidance or connect you with relevant resources.

**6. Reasons for Choosing the UK:**

*   **Vibrant Startup Ecosystem:** London, in particular, is a global hub for startups, offering access to talent, investors, and a supportive network.
*   **Access to Funding:** With your current VC backing and desire for angel funding, the UK provides a diverse landscape of investors, including angel networks, venture capital firms, and government-backed schemes.
*   **Strong Economy:** A stable and established economy provides a conducive environment for business growth and market entry.
*   **English as a Primary Language:** This eliminates the need to learn a new language for business operations and daily life, aligning with your "No-Language-Test Route" preference.
*   **Global Connectivity:** Excellent transport links and a strategic location make it easy to connect with international markets and partners.

Given your profile – a German national with significant funding, a desire for an immigration pathway through a startup, and a preference for no language test and company setup support – the **United Kingdom's Innovator Founder visa** is a highly recommended and viable option for you to launch and scale your venture.
