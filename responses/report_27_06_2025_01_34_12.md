### **United Kingdom: Innovator Founder Visa**

The UK's Innovator Founder visa is designed for experienced business people seeking to establish an innovative, scalable, and viable business in the UK. Your current funding status and established revenue make you a strong candidate for this route.Thank you for providing such detailed information. Based on your profile, particularly your German and Polish nationalities, your significant VC funding, your interest in the UK and Ireland, and your long-term goal of an immigration pathway, the **UK Innovator Founder Visa** appears to be a strong option.

Here's a breakdown of the UK Innovator Founder Visa requirements, tailored to your situation:

**UK Innovator Founder Visa – Detailed Requirements (2024/2025)**

This visa is designed for individuals looking to establish a business in the UK based on an innovative, viable, and scalable business idea. You must play a key role in the day-to-day management and development of the business. This route also leads to settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) after 5 years, provided you meet continuous residence and salary requirements. Dependants (spouse/partner and children) are allowed to apply with you, though additional funds will be required.

**Key Requirements & How they Relate to You:**

1.  **Endorsement:** You will need an endorsement from an approved endorsing body in the UK. This body will assess your business idea based on three criteria:
    *   **Innovation:** Your idea must be original, unique, or new to the UK market. Given your "Highly tech-driven" startup, this should align well.
    *   **Viability:** The business must be realistic with potential for growth and job creation. Your VC backing and "Established Revenue" indicate strong viability.
    *   **Scalability:** It must have the potential for national or international expansion. Your current funding status suggests this is a key objective.
    *   **Business Plan:** You'll need a credible and detailed business plan to support your application for endorsement.

2.  **Investment Funds:**
    *   For new businesses, you typically need to show access to **£50,000** in investment funds. As you are already backed by VCs with significant funding secured, this should not be an issue.
    *   **Important Note for Co-Founders:** Since you are relocating with a co-founder, **each applicant must be individually endorsed and each must show access to £50,000** (for new businesses). This means your co-founder will also need to meet the investment fund requirement.

3.  **Personal Savings (Maintenance Funds):** You must have at least **£1,270** held for 28 consecutive days before applying. For your spouse/partner, additional funds will be required.

4.  **English Language Requirement:** You will need to demonstrate English language proficiency at a **B2 (upper-intermediate)** level in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. This can be evidenced by an IELTS or other approved test, a degree taught in English, or nationality from a majority English-speaking country. While you prefer a "No-Language-Test Route," this is a mandatory requirement for the Innovator Founder Visa. Your German and Polish nationalities do not exempt you from this.

5.  **Suitability Requirements:**
    *   You must not fall under general grounds for refusal (e.g., criminality, deception). You mentioned a past visa denial that was successfully appealed, which is important to disclose but should not be an issue if it was successfully resolved. You also confirmed no criminal record for you or your dependents.
    *   If applying from within the UK, you must not be in breach of immigration laws.

6.  **Tuberculosis (TB) Certificate:** This is required for applicants from listed countries. You are currently based in Poland, so you will need to check if Poland is on the list (see Appendix T of UK immigration rules).

7.  **Application Process:**
    *   You must apply online via gov.uk and be granted entry clearance before arriving in the UK.
    *   Biometrics are required for all applicants.
    *   You cannot enter as a visitor and then switch to this visa.

8.  **Fees (2024/2025):**
    *   Application Fee: Typically around £1,191 (outside UK) or £1,486 (inside UK), but subject to change.
    *   Immigration Health Surcharge: Approximately £624 per year (subject to change).
    *   Endorsement Fee: Varies by endorsing body, often £1,000 + VAT.

**Considerations for Your Profile:**

*   **VC Backing:** Your significant funding is a major advantage for meeting the investment fund requirement.
*   **Co-Founder:** Remember that your co-founder will need to meet all individual requirements, including endorsement and funds.
*   **English Language:** You will likely need to take an approved English language test to meet the B2 requirement, as your nationalities do not provide an exemption.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** The UK is an established market, aligning with your "Established Revenue" geographic preference.

**Next Steps:**

I recommend researching and connecting with approved endorsing bodies in the UK. They will be crucial in assessing your business idea and providing the necessary endorsement for your visa application. You can find a list of approved endorsing bodies on the UK government's website.
