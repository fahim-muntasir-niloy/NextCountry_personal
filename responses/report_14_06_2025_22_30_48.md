**Important Note on Relocation:**

You mentioned a preference for "No, I prefer remote investment." However, the Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa is designed for individuals who will be actively running a business in Taiwan. While specific details on physical presence requirements would need to be confirmed during the application process, an "active business investment" typically implies a degree of physical presence and engagement in the country where the business is established. You should be prepared for the possibility of needing to relocate to Taiwan to manage your business effectively, especially given your goal of running the business yourself.

To proceed, we would focus on preparing a strong application demonstrating your innovative business plan in the technology sector and how it meets the investment or innovation criteria for the Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa.

Based on your investment goals and preferences, Taiwan presents a viable opportunity for your investment migration, particularly through its **Entrepreneur Visa** program. China does not currently offer investment visa programs that align with your specified investment budget of less than $100,000.

### **Taiwan: A Suitable Investment Destination**

Taiwan is an excellent choice for your investment, especially given your interest in the "Technology, Chips, electronics etc" sector and your desire for an active business investment. Taiwan is a global leader in the technology industry, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing, making it an ideal environment for establishing and growing a business in this field. The government actively supports innovation and entrepreneurship, which aligns with your goal of running your own business.

### **Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa**

The Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa is designed for foreign entrepreneurs looking to establish innovative businesses in Taiwan. This visa category aligns with your preference for an active business investment.

**Key Requirements and Features:**

*   **Investment Threshold:** You must establish an enterprise with innovation capability in Taiwan with an investment of at least NT$1 million (approximately **USD 31,000**). This falls well within your stated investment budget of less than $100,000 and your liquid cash availability of $1 million+.
*   **Business Activity:** As an active investor, you will be required to serve as the legal representative, manager, or director of the established business. This fulfills your desire to run your business in the new country.
*   **Innovation Capability:** Your business must demonstrate innovation capability. This can be evidenced by:
    *   Receiving venture capital investment or international fundraising of more than NT$2 million (approximately USD 62,000).
    *   Receiving approval to reside at a recognized innovation park or incubator.
    *   Obtaining patent rights or a professional skills certificate.
    *   Being awarded in a leading startup or design competition.
    *   Being located in a government-recognized startup accelerator.
    *   Being nominated or awarded in a film festival.
    *   Receiving an innovation subsidy of at least NT$3 million from the central government or at least NT$1 million from the local government.
    *   Possessing innovation capability specified or recommended by the Taiwanese government.
*   **Residency and Extension:** The visa grants a two-year residency, which can be extended without leaving Taiwan, provided your business continues to meet the requirements (e.g., achieving NT$3 million in sales revenue in the most recent year for extension).
*   **Family Inclusion:** Your spouse and children under 20 years old can also apply for residence as dependents, which aligns with your family application.

**Important Consideration: Relocation vs. Remote Investment**

You indicated a preference for "No, I prefer remote investment." However, the Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa requires you to actively run your business and serve as its legal representative, manager, or director. While some initial setup might be managed remotely, actively running a business and fulfilling the role of a legal representative or director in Taiwan typically implies a significant physical presence and engagement in the country. It is crucial to understand that this visa is designed for individuals who intend to actively participate in and oversee their business operations within Taiwan. Therefore, a complete "remote investment" as a primary mode of operation might not align with the spirit and requirements of this active business visa.

We can further explore the specifics of what "remote investment" entails for you to determine if there are any flexibilities or if a different strategy might be more suitable if physical relocation is absolutely not an option.
